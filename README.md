## QGroundControl Integration

QGroundControl (QGC) is a powerful tool for mission planning and UAV control. This section demonstrates how to use the boards in this repository for telemetry and control with QGC, even without an RC controller.

### Using ELRS Boards with QGC
1. Connect the ground-based ELRS receiver to your GCS using a USB-to-UART adapter.
2. Ensure telemetry is enabled on your flight controller and configured for ELRS.
3. Launch QGC, and verify telemetry data is being received.

### Hardware Setup
Below is an example of the hardware setup for mission planning:
- **Ground Setup**: ELRS transmitter connected to the GCS via USB or mounted on the RC controller.
- **Onboard Setup**: ELRS receiver mounted on the UAV and connected to the flight controller.

> **Note:**  
> - More details about the transmission modes can be found in the [Transmission Modes Classification](Receivers%20and%20Transmitters/README.md).

> **Note:**  
> - ELRS requires proper binding and configuration to function as a telemetry link.

## TX Boards (Shared for Single Antenna, Antenna Diversity & True Diversity)

> **Note:**  
> The TX boards listed in this section are shared across **Single Antenna Mode, Antenna Diversity, and True Diversity** configurations.  
> - These boards are **not duplicated** under each diversity category to avoid redundancy.  
> - They are optimized for their respective frequencies (**2.4GHz** & **900MHz**) and ensure compatibility across all three configurations.  
> - **Gemini Mode (GM) and Gemini Xrossband (GemX) have their own TX boards**, so they are listed separately in their respective sections.

## 3. Gemini Mode Boards  

### RX Boards
> **Note:**  
> - The **Gemini RX boards** are actually the **True Diversity RX boards** operating in **Gemini Mode**.  
> - To enable **Gemini Mode**, set the **RX Antenna Mode** to **Gemini** via Lua script.  
> - **Single Antenna RX boards** can also operate in Gemini Mode but must use **Model 5** in **Model Config Matching** via Lua script.  
> - **Gemini-capable receivers** should use **Model 6** in **Model Config Matching**.  
> - Click on [üîó **Go to True Diversity Full Diversity RX Boards**](#2-true-diversity-or-full-diversity-boards) to view compatible receivers.
