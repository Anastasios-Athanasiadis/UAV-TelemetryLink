# TX Enclosures and RC Controller Mounts

This folder contains 3D-printable enclosures and mounting systems for transmitter boards used in long-range LoRa communication systems. These designs are intended to be mounted securely on RC controllers or other ground station platforms, ensuring optimal antenna placement, signal integrity, and protection of the electronics.

## üì¶ Included Designs

Each mount or enclosure is optimized for both mechanical stability and RF performance, and is designed to accommodate the following:

- **Transmitter types:**
  - TX1, TX2, TX3 (2.4GHz)
  - G_TX1 (Gemini 2.4GHz / 900MHz)
  - GX_TX1 (Gemini Xrossband 2.4GHz + 900MHz)

- **Antenna support:**
  - Moxon directional antennas (for reduced side lobe interference)
  - Omnidirectional vertical whips (for all-direction reception)
  - Mounts for both upright and tilted antenna positions

## üìê File Format Notes

- Files are provided in `.STL` format for direct 3D printing.
- - Some designs also include `.STEP`, `.Fusion360`, or SolidWorks-compatible files (`.SLDPRT`, `.SLDASM`) for customization.
- Be sure to orient the print flat on the base and use moderate infill (25‚Äì40%) for strength without excessive weight.
